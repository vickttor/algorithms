# Algorithms and Data Structure in Typescript

This repository keeps my progress learning data structure and algorithms in typescript.
By reading the book: "Entendo algoritmos, um guia ilustrado para programadores e outros curiosos" I could learn many concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and solve problem mindsets:

- Big O notation
- Recursion
- Binary Search
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Arrays vs Lists
- How memory works
- Logarithm
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Dikstra Algorithm
